NAME
       snapperoo  -  A  small,  bare essentials utility for taking Btrfs snap‐
       shots.


SYNOPSIS
       snapperoo.json


DESCRIPTION
       snapperoo is configured using a fairly simple JSON file.   By  default,
       this is read from /etc/snapperoo.json, but can be specified manually by
       setting the SNAPPEROO_CONFIG environment variable.


EXAMPLES
       The following is an example of a configuration that will keep:
         - 7 daily and 52 weekly snapshots of /, stored in /.snapshots/root
         - 24 hourly and 7  daily  snapshots  of  /home,  stored  in  /.snaph‐
       sots/home


              [
                {
                  "source": "/",
                  "target": "/.snapshots/root",
                  "schedules": {
                    "daily": {
                      "retention_count": 7
                    },
                    "weekly": {
                      "retention_count": 52
                    }
                  }
                },
                {
                  "source": "/home",
                  "target": "/.snapshots/home",
                  "schedules": {
                    "hourly": {
                      "retention_count": 24
                    },
                    "daily": {
                      "retention_count": 7
                    }
                  }
                }
              ]

       In  order  to  ensure  snapshotting functions as expected, this command
       should be called once per week by the job scheduling system of choice.
