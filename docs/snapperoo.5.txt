SNAPPEROO(5)                  File Formats Manual                 SNAPPEROO(5)



NAME
       snapperoo  -  A  small,  bare essentials utility for taking Btrfs snap‐
       shots.


SYNOPSIS
       snapperoo.json


DESCRIPTION
       snapperoo is configured using a fairly simple JSON file.   By  default,
       this is read from /etc/snapperoo.json, but can be specified manually by
       setting the SNAPPEROO_CONFIG environment variable.


EXAMPLES
       The following is an example of a configuration that will keep the  fol‐
       lowing periodic snapshots:
         -   7  daily  and  52  weekly  snapshots  of  /,  stored  in  /.snap‐
       shots/root/automatic
         - 24 hourly and 7  daily  snapshots  of  /home,  stored  in  /.snaph‐
       sots/home

       It  also  has provisions for event based snapshots of the root filesys‐
       tem, to be stored in /.snapshots/root/event.  In this case the schedule
       is  used to define the event that triggers the snapshot, in the example
       the following snapshots are kept:
         - 10 taken before the start of package updates
         - Infinitely many taken before a configuration change is made
         - Infinitely many taken manually

       Use of all should be considered carefully as this could  use  excessive
       disk space.

                  }
                }
              ]

       In  order  to  ensure  snapshotting functions as expected, this command
       should be called once per week by the job scheduling system of choice.
